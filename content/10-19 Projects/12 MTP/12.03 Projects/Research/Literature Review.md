## Topic

Improving Peer Code Review Quality with Gamification

## Problem

- Peer code review is a fundamental part of being a professional software developer, yet many Computer Science students lack this key skill.
- If students are demotivated to give quality feedback to each other, then one mechanism to motivate them could be gamification.

## Questions

1. What are the different kinds of gamification in education contexts?
2. How does gamification affect student motivation?
3. Why are Computer Science students demotivated to give quality feedback?
4. How can Computer Science teachers implement a gamified peer code feedback strategy?

## Outline

If this were a Venn diagram, I would have 3 circles for gamification, peer feedback, and motivation. Maybe another circle for Computer Science specifically?

### Articles about Gamification

### Articles about Peer Feedback and Computer Science

The peer feedback process in a Computer Science context can be referred to as peer code review. Thus, we should read about peer code review in Computer Science education, the value of peer code review, how to do peer code review, and most importantly, how to gamify the peer code review process.

# Improving computer science students peer code review quality through games based learning

- Overview of the literature review's focus and narrative.
- Importance of peer code review in computer science education.
- Statement of the problem: Low motivation among CS students in providing quality peer feedback.

## 1. The Importance of Peer Code Review in Computer Science Education

### 1.1 Peer code review is a critical skill for software developers.

Peer code review plays a crucial role in computer science education as it not only reinforces technical skills but also fosters collaborative learning and critical thinking. By examining and providing feedback on their peers' code, students sharpen their understanding of coding standards, best practices, and software design principles. Moreover, engaging in peer code review helps students develop the ability to communicate effectively with their peers and learn from each other's mistakes.

In addition, peer code review simulates real-world scenarios where software developers often work in teams and collaborate on projects. By honing their skills in giving and receiving constructive feedback, students prepare themselves for the professional environment they will enter upon graduation. This practice also contributes to a more thorough understanding of different programming languages, problem-solving techniques, and industry-specific tools and technologies.(Indriasari et al., 2020)(Turner & Pérez-Quiñones, 2009)(Cross, 1987)

### 1.2 Benefits of effective peer code review for CS students.

Engaging in peer code review also helps students in developing their analytical skills and attention to detail, which are essential for identifying and fixing bugs and errors in code. Additionally, it encourages students to think critically about alternative solutions and approaches, thereby broadening their problem-solving capabilities.

## 2. Motivational Theories in Peer Feedback

### 2.1 Motivation is a key factor for student engagement. 

Motivational theories play a crucial role in understanding and addressing the issue of low motivation among computer science students in providing quality peer feedback. Some key motivational theories relevant to education include Self-Determination Theory, Expectancy Theory, and Goal Setting Theory. Self-Determination Theory suggests that students are motivated when their psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are satisfied. Expectancy Theory posits that motivation is influenced by the belief that effort will lead to performance and performance will lead to outcomes. Finally, Goal Setting Theory emphasizes the importance of setting specific and challenging goals to enhance student motivation and performance. Understanding these motivational theories can provide insights into how to effectively motivate computer science students to actively engage in and provide meaningful peer feedback during code review processes.

The application of motivational theories to understand student motivation in peer feedback is pivotal in identifying effective strategies for engagement. Theories such as Self-Determination Theory (SDT) elucidate how factors like autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence students' intrinsic motivation to provide constructive peer feedback. Additionally, Vygotsky's Social Development Theory highlights the role of social interaction in learning, suggesting that collaborative environments like peer review can enhance motivation through meaningful engagement and shared understanding. These theoretical frameworks provide a foundation for exploring how motivational dynamics specifically manifest in the context of peer feedback in computer science education.

### 2.3 CS students lack of motivation is a challenge for for quality peer code review.

Motivating computer science students to engage in quality peer code review presents specific challenges. Studies reveal that student-generated peer reviews often lack depth and specificity, described as short and non-committal, failing to meet the expectations for useful feedback. This indicates a need for strategies that enhance student engagement in the peer review process, ensuring that the feedback is not only frequent but also meaningful and constructive. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the learning outcomes in programming courses, where peer code review is an essential component.(Indriasari et al., 2020)(Indriasari et al., 2021)

## 4. Gamification and Game-Based Learning in Education can Increase Student Motivation in Peer Review

### 4.1 Definition and distinction between gamification and game-based learning.

Gamification and game-based learning are two distinct approaches to education that incorporate elements of games.

Gamification involves integrating game design elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, into non-game contexts to enhance engagement and motivation. It does not necessarily involve playing a game, but rather the use of game elements to make an activity more game-like and engaging.

On the other hand, game-based learning refers to using games to deliver specific educational content. This can include digital games, board games, or other types of games designed for educational purposes. Game-based learning directly involves playing a game as part of the learning process.

In summary, gamification involves the use of game elements in non-game contexts, while game-based learning involves the use of games to deliver educational content.

### 4.2 Theoretical perspective: Extrinsic motivation in gamification vs. intrinsic motivation in game-based learning.

In gamification, extrinsic motivation is often employed through the use of external rewards such as points, badges, or leaderboards to encourage desired behaviours or actions. This type of motivation comes from outside the individual and is not inherently related to the activity itself.

On the other hand, game-based learning typically focuses on intrinsic motivation, which arises from the activity itself. In this approach, the engagement and enjoyment derived from playing the game are directly linked to the learning process. The challenge, curiosity, and enjoyment inherent in the game itself motivate the learners.

Therefore, while gamification relies on extrinsic motivators like rewards and recognition, game-based learning emphasizes intrinsic motivators such as enjoyment and engagement with the game and its educational content.

### 4.3. Game-Based Learning is an effective instructional strategy in Computer Science Education

Game-based learning applications in computer science education are diverse and designed to engage students in various aspects of the field. For instance, in computer science, games are utilized to teach algorithms, data structures, networks, software testing, and programming languages. This approach allows students to not only learn complex concepts in an interactive and fun way but also fosters critical thinking and collaboration skills. One of the key benefits is the bridging of the gap between theory and practice, enabling students to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts.
