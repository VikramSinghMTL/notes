## Why do you want to study this topic?

- I believe that peer code review is a fundamental skill for software developers, yet traditional approaches don't always engage or motivate Computer Science students. I want to explore how to transform peer code review into a meaningful and valuable activity that fosters genuine learning and skill development.

## Why does the topic and context matter to you personally?

- I've seen firsthand how disengaged students can be during the peer review process. Providing superficial feedback benefits neither the reviewer nor the reviewee. I want to help create a classroom environment where feedback is constructive and where students feel empowered as part of the development process.

## Why might it matter to others?

- **Future Developers:** Quality peer review skills are essential for success in software development. Finding ways to motivate student engagement with the process creates better-equipped programmers entering the workforce.
- **Educators:** This research aims to provide educators with tools to make peer code review more effective. This translates to better learning outcomes for CS students.
- **The Broader Field:** Deeper understanding of student motivation in the specific context of peer code review contributes to the knowledge base of computer science education and learning theory.

## What experience/s led you to this topic?

- As both a CS student and a programming teaching assistant, I've experienced first-hand the benefits of good code review and the frustrations of low-effort attempts. This fuels my desire to find solutions that bridge this gap.

## What aspects (variables) of this topic will you have to examine?

- **Current Motivational State:** What factors currently influence student engagement in peer code reviews (or their lack thereof)?
- **Game-Based Learning Elements:** What motivational game elements (e.g., rewards, challenges, social components) would resonate with CS students?
- **Quality of Feedback:** How can we define and measure "quality feedback" and assess if the game-based approach improves it?
- **Perceived Value:** Do students perceive the game-based learning approach as valuable and related to their development as software engineers?

## Putting it Together: A Draft Conceptual Framework Narrative

This research is motivated by the observation that peer code review, a crucial skill for software development, is often undermined by a lack of student motivation. This study proposes a game-based learning approach to address this, informed by motivational theories like Self-Determination Theory.

The study examines the impact of specific game elements on student motivation, the resulting quality of code review feedback, and students' perceptions of the value of this approach. Outcomes of this research have the potential to benefit students, educators, and the field of computer science education as a whole.
